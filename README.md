## 🛠️ Features Considered But Not Included

During development, several features were explored but not included to maintain clarity, accessibility, and a calming user experience:

- **Image Carousel:**  
  Initially planned for the hero or resource sections to showcase tips and affirmations. Removed as it disrupted the calm, focused flow of the site and could distract users seeking support.

- **Breathing Animation:**  
  A guided breathing exercise animation was prototyped to help users manage stress. It was omitted to keep the interface simple and avoid overwhelming first-time visitors. This feature may be revisited in future updates.

- **Live Chat Widget:**  
  Considered for instant support, but excluded to maintain privacy and reduce technical complexity for a static site.

---

## 🌓 Partial Integrations

- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle Animation:**  
  More elaborate transitions were tested but replaced with a subtle, accessible toggle for a smoother experience.

These decisions were made to ensure the site remains approachable, fast, and easy to navigate for all users.

## 🎨 Colour Palette

The color palette was selected for its calming and accessible qualities. Soft blues and neutral tones help create a relaxed atmosphere, while accent colors provide enough contrast for clear readability. The choices aim to support a welcoming and easy-to-use experience for everyone.
