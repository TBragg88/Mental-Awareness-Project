## üìù Portfolio Project 1: Project Overview

**The Awareness Project** offers beginner-friendly resources in a calming, organized, and accessible format. The site features a clean UI, smooth navigation, and interactive wellness tools to help users manage stress and learn about mental health.

## üåü Brief

-   A cohesive one-page layout with a main navigation menu and structured content. Semantic use of HTML. Adherence to accessibility guidelines
-   Information organised using UX principles, User-initiated actions with immediate feedback
-   HTML and CSS code passing W3C and Jigsaw validators with no issues.
-   Consistent layout across different screen sizes due to CSS media queries. Clear and semantic HTML structure. Intuitive, functional navigation on the single page.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features Considered But Not Included

During development, several features were explored but ultimately not included in the final project to maintain clarity, accessibility, and a calming user experience:

- **Image Carousel:**  
  Initially planned for the hero or resource sections to showcase tips and affirmations. Removed as it disrupted the calm, focused flow of the site and could distract users seeking support.

- **Breathing Animation:**  
  A guided breathing exercise animation was prototyped to help users manage stress. It was omitted to keep the interface simple and avoid overwhelming first-time visitors. This feature may be revisited in future updates.

- **Live Chat Widget:**  
  Considered for instant support, but excluded to maintain privacy and reduce technical complexity for a static site. (I dont know how to Javascript)

## Partial Integration

- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle Animation:**  
  More elaborate transitions were tested but replaced with a subtle, accessible toggle for a smoother experience.

These decisions were made to ensure the site remains approachable, fast, and easy to navigate for all users.

- Changes include: Removal of the carousel: didn't fit with theme of the project.

## üé® Colour Palette

The color palette was selected for its calming and accessible qualities. Soft blues and neutral tones help create a relaxed atmosphere, while accent colors provide enough contrast for clear readability. The choices aim to support a welcoming and easy-to-use experience for everyone.

## üöÄ How AI Was Used

# How AI Enhanced This Project

Artificial Intelligence played a crucial role in shaping this project, streamlining development, and improving overall efficiency. Here‚Äôs how AI was leveraged:

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Code Generation

AI-powered tools, such as **GitHub Copilot**, provided structured **HTML and CSS code snippets**, offering initial support in streamlining development. However, upon review, I identified numerous extraneous classes and attributes that required refinement and optimization for cleaner, more efficient code.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Debugging & Optimization

Advanced **AI debugging tools** examined the codebase, **detected errors**, and suggested solutions, streamlining the development process. This helped minimize bugs, improve stability, and provided an additional verification layer, ensuring AI-generated outputs met quality standards upon review.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Generated Imagery

**DALL-E**, an AI model developed by OpenAI, was utilized to generate all images for the website. It provided a seamless experience, delivering consistent results across a diverse range of prompts.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Content Assistance

**GitHub Copilot** played a pivotal role in **text refinement**, delivering real-time auto-completions and intelligent suggestions that streamlined development. Every blurb on the page was AI-generated, seamlessly fitting within the overall context and enhancing readability.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Accessibility Improvements

AI-driven tools, such as **Lighthouse**, assessed the website‚Äôs **accessibility features**, providing recommendations to ensure a **user-friendly experience** for individuals with disabilities.

### üîπ By integrating AI-driven solutions, this project benefited from increased **efficiency, creativity, and accessibility**, resulting in a more refined and user-centric platform.
